# C.C.C Obanikoro website

## Welcome!ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out our church website.

## Challenge 
Our challenge was to build out a church website and get it looking as cool as ever.

We used tools like HTML5, CSS3, Taliwindcss and JavaScript to build the website. 

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size.
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page.

## Where to find everything

All the required assets for this project are in the `/images` folder.
We also used Google fonts, Google icons and Fonts awesome.
